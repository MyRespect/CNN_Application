Face Recognition and Object Detection are mainly based on Coursera Course "Convolutional Neural Networks" by Andrew Ng. There are many duplicate code source that you can find on Github, and I just save the notes about the course.

Image Generation are mainly based on the official Tensorflow 2.0 tutorial.
